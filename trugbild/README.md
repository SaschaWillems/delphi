## Note
This folder only contains the core source files of "Trugbild", missing basecode and all data files that would be necessary to compile a complete project.

## About
"Trugbild" (german for "delusion") was my entry for the 2013 Pascal Game Development challenge.

The theme was "indirect control", so I went on to create a game where you control a dying character through a series of thoughts.
